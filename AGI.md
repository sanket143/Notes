title: AGI

me too, AGI is much broader than what I was assuming, it is much
more than human intelligence. 

_.. that achieving real Human Level artificial intelligence would
necessarily imply that  most of the task that humans perform for
pay could be automated. Rather than work toward this goal of
automation by building special-purpose systems, I argue for the
development of general-purpose, educable systems that can learn
and be tought to perform any of the thousands of jobs that humans
can perform. Joining other who have made similar proposals,
I advocate beginning with a system that has minimal, although
extensive, built-in capabilities. These would have to include
the ability to improve through learning along wih many other
abilities._
