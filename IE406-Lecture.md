Unsupervised learning

- Transformation/KL transform
- DFT/DCT/PCA
- Transformation matrix is the fixed,
it is not dependant on input data.

PCA represents unsupervised learning.

Concepts of PCA

x1 & x2 input random variable

K means clustering
- Unsupervised Learning
- Finds coherent/similar subsets to form cluster
- Most popular clustering algorithm
  - Social network analysis
- Iterative algorithm
- Segments the data into k clusters after iterations

Algorithm involves two steps (Iteratively)
- Cluster Assignment step
- Move centroid step

**Cluster Assignment step:** Assign each data point
to one of the clusters board on minimum distance criteria.

**Most centroid step:** Compute the average (mean) of the
data points (vectors) belonging to each centroid and get
the new set of clusters.
