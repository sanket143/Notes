Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is considered to be the 'gold standard'
for talk therapy. Research shows that CBT is the most effective form of
treatment for depression and anxiety. CBT alone is 50-75% effective for
overcoming depression and anxiety after 8-15 sessions. Medication alone
is 50-75% effective, however, science still does not understand the long
term effects on the brain and body. Medication and CBT combined is most
effective, with 75-90% of people overcoming mental illness.

Metal illness can be considered as the most expensive illness if it's
not treated. Depression is one the most common mental illness and one of
the least understood. After studying 3,875 people, self-guided online
CBT is found to be significantly more effective in lowering depression
symptoms compared to face-to-face treatment. Other study findings show
that the treatment adherence of online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
is 82%. Treatment adherence is how likely someone is to follow a 
treatment plan. Over 86% of starling minds self-guided online CBT users
will improve their mental health and become more mentally fit.
