We’ve been living under the threat of a global health crisis triggered by nuclear war for decades. But nuclear weapons are not a virus: we have the solution to get rid of them and we need to act before it’s too late.

CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic

Case fatality rates was even higher

The 1918 influenza pandemic was the most
severe pandemic in recent history which was
caused by H1N1 virus with genes of avian

Testing, having smart epidemilogist
why there
There are medical practices that did
cured the pandemic spread. South Korea
took advantage of February to perform
tests for . They
never had to go to that phase of lock
the whole country. Testing

I would like to address the case of South
Korea during the Covid-19 crisis.

South Korea was the one country which
was able to administer successful response
to the Covid-19 pandemic. As per the list
of 2018, South Korea doesn't even come
in top 15 of the most advanced medically
advanced countries in the world. As per the current rankings for best-healthcare
in the world. South Korea is at 58.

Despite being not so advanced in medical
system, they never had to go through the
phase of nation lockdown to fight Covid-19.
MERS hit South Korea in May
2018 and the government failed to protect
Korean people. Due to this experience with
MERS, hospitals had the protective medical
equipment and facilities necessary to
isolate suspected patients, and the people
had access to this care under South Korea's
national health insurance system. They used
their cutting-edge IT infrastructure to
quickly identified those who may have come
into contact with confirmed Covid-19 cases.
Moreover, experts from the Korea Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention were actively
participating to give detailed updates on
the situation. The people were also 
voluntarily following all guidelines given
by the experts to prevent infections. They
make a good use of January and February to
prepare for what's coming.

Similar to the case of plague in Egypt where
the followed a better medical public practices
which helped a lot to fight the plague. 

I would like to address the case of South
Korea during the COVID-19 crisis.
