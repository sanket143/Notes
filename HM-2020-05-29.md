# Digital Platforms - The Shaping of a Burgeoning Technology

### Historical View
- Rooted in the dot-com bubble of the 1990s which was iteself
a product of the gradual crisis in the manufacturing sectors
of the post-war advanced econnomics (USA, Germany, Japan)
- Lower profits, Lower wages, lower interest rates
- 90s - 50,000 companies were formed to commercialize the
internet and more than $256 billion was invested
- Concretely, this investment meant that millions of miles
fibre-optic and submarine cables were laid out, major
advances in software and network design were established, and
large investments in databases and server were made
- The process would repeat itself post-2008

### Data - The core of the platform

- The main benefit of being the medium of interactions is
to be able to record and analyze the data they generate
- This data becomes the key driver of greater monetization
and efficiency
- It creates network effects, which lead to centralization.

### A model made for monopolies
- Growth before profits, banking on VC money
- Network effects and Data advantages
- Utility-like dependency
- Competition via closing others out: OS wars, Net Neutrality,
Facebook Free Basics
