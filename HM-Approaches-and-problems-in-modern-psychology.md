### **Mental Illness: A growing global concer**

- Close to 970 million people suffers from mental disorder
- 20% of indian population suffers from mental disorder
- WHO estimate was a prediction from few years ago

### **Predominant approaches**

- Biological
  - Based on the advent and advances of neuroscience
  - Conceives of a asyche as the product of chemical processes
  - Most dominant research paradigm today.
- Cognitive
  - Aims to map internal processes of the mind.
  - Developed around the information processing metaphor
  - Closely allied to AI
  - Tries to map the mind as processes/computations
  - Metaphor is kind of a computer
  - Working of neurons => hardware that generates 
- Socio-cultural
  - Older humanist tradition
  - Sees interpersonal relationship and personal 'meaning' as key
  - Against reductionnism. Normative prescription
  - Therapies that doesn't use drugs, somewhere use socio-cultural
  paradigm

### **Theoretical Questions**

- The status of the psychosomatic illness?
- The autonomy of mental processes?
- While new approches he biological effects of cultural
phenomena, what about studying the mechanisms that
regulate this interaction?

One of the central debates
**Nature vs Nuruture Debate**

- Genetics - Epigenetics: Genetic code is re written based on
interactions.
- Genetic evolves
- Strucuture of the brain is not even static, keep evolves
- External factors influences the core of peoples biology
gives a ground to Nurture
- Disorders, ... 

_psychosomatic illness_: physical illness but not physical cause,
like an illusion. You can't find any physical illness using biological
metrics but the symptoms persists.

**Theoretical Concerns**

- _The Diagnostics and Statistics Manual_
- Homosexuality, Body-Dysmorphia, Hysteria => Disorders (Natural/Mental)
- ADHD: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
- Alcohol and Depression => Mental Disorders

### **The direction of research**

- Increasingly, psychological knowledge is being employed as a policy
tool, or a business strategy, as opposed to a means to treat illness.
- The growth of public relations, 'focus groups', the psychology of
'priming', and behavioral economics.
- At what point are these developments consistent with social freedom
and democracy?
- Psychology concepts that tries to keep nudging people to go in a
path where we want them to go.

### **The soaring of prescription drugs**

- Half a million people above 65 die every year due to these drugs,
and long term rates of disability due to psychological illnes have
actually gone up over the years.
- Long term side effects and dependencies that can be dangerous
  - solely dependent on drugs can lead them to depression, anxiety
  and make them into abusive relations

**Individualizing a social malaise**

- Growth in psychological disorders over tha last 4 decades point
towards social factors that are increasing levels of distress
amongst people
- This period has conincided with a series of economic displacements,
precarious labour, unemployment, environmental destruction and so forth.
- There is little study of the way mass psychology has been affected
by transformations in daily life, be they technological, geopolitical,
or economic.
- Depressed person are more likely to project the problem in others
by being violent and rude.

### **Psychology in the domain of politics: Identity and Recognition**

- Recognition and the politics of emotional experience as a vital political
category
- Social and mutual recognition and respect as the basis for agency
- Challenging normativity, reclaiming and politicizing certain experiences

### **A plea for more/better theory**

Without understanding, political discourses rooted in psychology will
simply be hijacked. However, this means confronting difficult subjects
like the unconscious.
