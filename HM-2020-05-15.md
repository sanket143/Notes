### **Sciece and Value: An Enduring Controversy**

_The claim of the value neutrality of science
is that scientific knowledge neither supports
nor undermines any value judgement._

### **Heidegger's Critique**

- Science as a horizon of meaning, inaugurated
by Modernity
- Technological Thinking, perceiving the
world as a standing reserve
- The will to endless knowledge, knowledge
as an end itself

Beliefs
- Scientific form of thinking, first
instrumental thinking
- Perception of see things, everything is
an instrument.

### **Crossing a line that ought to be preserved - Wisdom in the Ancient Western Tradition**

- The Pythogoreans
- The Stoic Concept of Prudence
- Greek Mythology - The Stories of
Prometheus and Daedalus

_Prometheus_: Titans, Immortal beings but not god
who stole fire from the god, vanished for
enternity.

_Icarus_

### **The Perverse Accumulation of Knowledge**

_The Physiologist is not ordinary man: he is
the scientist possessed and abosorbed by the
scientific idea he pursues. He does not hear
the cry of animals, he does not see
the flowing of blood; he sees nothing but the
idea and is aware of nothing but the
organism that conceals from him the problem
he is seeking to resolve._

_The mass killings in the concentration
camps cannot be subsumed under any of the
old categories...._

**Examples**

Adolf Eichmann: Psycholgically normal,
exemplary family man. Thought of himself
as a scientist

The Atomic Bomb: Game theoretic perspective,
post-hiroshima research on radiation

Bio-medical research: Nazi experiments in
asylums, use of the poor and elderly in the
16/17th century

### **The pilfering of nature**

_"The art of inquiry into nature,
and/or puttting it on the rack"_
- Francis Bacon

The onset of the anthropocence

Critiques from deep ecology and indigenous
cultures

Ecology as a way to calibrate this notion
