# Rust Book

Variable in rust are immutable by default. i.e. once declare and defined.
They cannot be changed and will lead the compiler to throw an error while
compiling. We need to explicitely state that certain variable is mutable
using `mut` keyword.

Also Rust try to use Stack most of the times. It has different data types
that uses heap whenever required.
