### Carbon Nanotubes

Carbon
- Graphite
- Diamond
- Nanotube/Fullerene

n == m -> Armchair
n != m -> Chiral
n, 0 -> Zip-Zag

#### Properties
- 132,000,000:1 Length-To-Diameter Ratio
- Diameter of 3 to 9 nm
- Length in the millimeter range
- Efficient electrical conductors

Carbon nanotubes are the strongest ever known material

**Stiffness** is the extent to which an object can resists
deformation in response to an applied force.

1250 GPa - Young Modulus (Stiffness)
11-64 GPa - Tensile strength (Breaking Strength)
1.33-1.40 gram/cm^3 - Density

#### Arc discharge method
- Easiest way to produce CNTs.
- Produces both single and multi-walled nanotubes

- Cathode (-ve)
- Anode (+ve)
- Inert Gas
- Depositions

#### Chemical vapor deposition
- Nanotubes grow at the sitse of the metal catalyst

#### Laser ablation
- A pulsed laser vaporizes a graphite target in a high-temperature reactor
- Nanotyubes develop on the cooler surfaces of the reactor

#### Ball mining
- Powder graphite is placed in a stainless
