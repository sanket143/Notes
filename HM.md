South Korea was the one country that
was able to administer a successful response
to the COVID-19 pandemic. As per the list
of 2018, South Korea did not get counted
in the top 15 of the **most medically advanced**
countries in the world. As per the
2020 rankings for **best-healthcare**
in the world. South Korea is at 58.

Despite being not so advanced in the medical
system, they never had to go through the
phase of nation lockdown to fight COVID-19.
MERS hit South Korea in May
2018 and the government failed to protect
Korean people. Due to this experience with
MERS, hospitals had the protective medical
equipment and facilities necessary to
isolate suspected patients, and the people
had access to this care under South Korea's
national health insurance system. They used
their cutting-edge IT infrastructure to
quickly identify those who may have come
into contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases
and put those into isolation to prevent spread.
Moreover, experts from the Korea Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention were actively
participating to give detailed updates on
the situation. The people were also 
voluntarily following all the guidelines given
by the experts to prevent infections. They
make good use of January and February to
prepare for what's coming.

We can compare this case with the case of the plague in Egypt where
they followed better medical public practices to fight the plague.
