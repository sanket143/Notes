### **Whitebox Testing**

- Tests the internal mechanism.
- Whether code worked as expected or not.
- Exercises paths in a code
- Also exercises internal data strucuture
that whether it is valid or not.

Levels of the testing
- Unit level testing
- Integration testing
- System testing

**Techniques**
- Control flow based
- Data flow based
- Code coverage
- Mutation testing

**Control flow based testing**

- Create a graph describing the flow
of control
  - manually or automatically
- Design test cases to cover certain
elements of this graph
  - Nodes, edges, paths

**Control Flow Graph**

Three kind of notes
- Statement nodes: represent single entry singly exit
- Predicate nodes: represent conditions
- Auxiliary nodes: join points
